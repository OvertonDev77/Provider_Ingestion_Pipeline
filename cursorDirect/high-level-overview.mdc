- This project fetches provider data from the NPI Registry API using async requests and stores it in a Supabase Postgres database.
- The workflow includes: async API requests (with rate limiting and retries), parsing and mapping results, and upserting into the NPIRehabs table.
- The system can be triggered via command line or a FastAPI endpoint (/run-npi-workflow).
- Docker is used for environment consistency and data persistence.
- All database operations use upsert logic to avoid duplicates.
