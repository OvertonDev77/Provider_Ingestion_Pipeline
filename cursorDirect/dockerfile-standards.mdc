- Use python:3.11-slim as the base image.
- Always use a WORKDIR of /app.
- Install dependencies from requirements.txt before copying the rest of the code.
- Use VOLUME for /app/data to persist data.
- Expose port 8000 for FastAPI server usage.
- Set a sensible default CMD, but allow override for server (e.g., uvicorn server:app).
