- Use aiohttp and asyncio for all external API requests.
- Implement rate limiting and retry logic for all API calls (see NPI API constraints).
- Use pagination (limit/skip) to fetch all available results, respecting API-imposed maximums.
- Use taxonomy_description for NPI API queries when possible.
- Always parse and validate API responses before storing in the database.
- Log errors and retry attempts for traceability.
