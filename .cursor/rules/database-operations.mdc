- Use explicit SQL for table creation and migrations. Example: use `npi_number` as a unique key for upserts.
- Always use upsert logic (on_conflict) when inserting NPI data to avoid duplicates.
- Use snake_case for all column names.
- Store important provider fields: npi_number, organization_name, address, city, state, postal_code, phone, taxonomy_code, taxonomy_desc, authorized_official, last_updated.
- Use varchar/text types for string fields, and date for date fields.
- Prefer explicit field mapping when parsing API results for DB insertion.
